            <ul class="project-points">
                <li>Implemented authentication and authorization via cookies; used OTP verification for password resets.
                </li>
                <li>Enabled post creation, reactions (likes and dislikes), sharing, and commenting.</li>
                <li>Integrated real-time messaging with SignalR and built a notification system for user interactions.
                </li>
                <li>Designed a profile system allowing users to edit their profiles, upload or remove profile pictures, and view
                    interaction history.</li>

            <h2>Image & Audio Steganography Tool</h2>
            <h3 class="tech-stack">Tech Used: Java (Core), Swing Framework</h3>
            <ul class="project-points">
                <li>Built a Java GUI app for LSB steganography to hide encrypted text in PNG and WAV files.</li>
                <li>Used Caesar cipher with a user-defined shift value; embedded cipher key within hidden data.</li>
                <li>Applied OOP principles and handled RGB pixel manipulation and WAV sample encoding with Least
                    Significant Bit of Least Significant Byte, supporting Little Endian format.</li>
                <li>Implemented custom decoding logic for accurate extraction and decryption from image and audio files.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Huffman Encoder & Decoder</h2>
            <h3 class="tech-stack">Tech Used: Java (Core), Swing Framework</h3>
            <ul class="project-points">
                <li>Developed a Java-based file compression and decompression tool using Huffman encoding and a
                    frequency-sorted Huffman tree.</li>
                <li>Implemented custom Huffman tree construction based on byte frequency and lexicographic ordering for
                    deterministic output.</li>
                <li>Created a <code>.huff</code> file format that stores compressed binary data along with metadata like
                    original extension and frequency table.</li>
                <li>Designed a bit-level encoding system with custom stream handling for accurate data
                    representation.</li>
                <li>Ensured lossless restoration during decompression by preserving structural and frequency integrity.
                </li>
                <li>Built an intuitive GUI with Java Swing to support seamless file selection, compression, and
                    decompression.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Project 4 -->
        <div class="project">
            <img src="assets/project_cover_photos/hotel.png" alt="HMS" class="project-image" />
            <h2>Hotel Management System and Hotel Booking Website</h2>
            <h3 class="tech-stack">Tech Used: ASP.NET 4.8, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and MS SQL Server</h3>
            <ul class="project-points">
                <li>The application offers modules for room booking, cancellations, check-in/out, guest and employee
                    management, inventory tracking, and an admin dashboard.</li>
                <li>OTP-based authentication is used during password recovery; an OTP is sent to the user's email,
                    ensuring secure identity verification before reset.</li>
                <li>Registration is supported for both hotel staff and website users, with options like “Remember Me”
                    for ease of login and user session persistence via cookies.</li>
